<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHcJIu70GGU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, visit `Appearance > Customize`, and select `Site Identity`. Click `Select Image`, and upload your preferred icon image. Click `Save & Publish` at the top of the page when you're done.

### Creating a menu

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sosfcXx2uwA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Harbor uses WordPress's built-in menu functionality. Visit `Appearance > Menus` to get started. `Primary` is the header navigation, and `Secondary` is the footer navigation.

## Donations

From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, visit `PayPal Donations`. Add your information, and click `Save` at the bottom of the page when you're done.

### Donations Form

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKATL2cypZw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Display your donations form on any page by using the `[[paypal_donations_form]]` shortcode. [View the live donation form demo.](http://harbor.gomakethings.com/donate/)

### Donations Buttons

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIA27R-GYKY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can also create one-off PayPal donation buttons using the `[[paypal_donations_button]]` shortcode.

**Example:**

[paypal_donations_button amount="25" label="Donate $25" recurring="true" description="Donate $25 to the Special Fund"]

```lang-php
[[paypal_donations_button amount="25" label="Donate $25" recurring="true" description="Donate $25 to the Special Fund"]]
```

If `amount` is left blank, donors will be asked to write in their own amount when they're sent to PayPal. All other fields are optional. `recurring="true"` makes the donation recurring. `description` is what is displayed on PayPal.com.

## Petfinder

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDGlBVhJE74?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, visit `Pet Listings > Options`. Add your information, select which filters should be visible, and click `Save` at the bottom of the page when you're done.

By default, your list of adoptable animals is displayed at `http://yourwebsite.com/pets`. This can be changed in the options.

## Page and Post Content

### Add a hero image header

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KWSOeJr63c?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Underneath the content section is a `Page Hero` section. Add your hero content there. In addition to text, you can also add an image or video.

To apply a background image to the hero, use the `Featured Image` section in the sidebar. If text is hard to read on the background image, check the box to add a `Background Image Overlay`.

### Create an image gallery

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5EFKavGKnY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Create beautiful, mosaic image galleries using the `[[gallery]]` shortcode, or the built-in gallery feature in the WordPress editor. View the [Image Galleries page](http://harbor.gomakethings.com/gallery/) to see a working example.

### Create a button link

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIHBKyGNYsQ?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Add bold calls to action in your content with the `[[button]]` shortcode:

[button link="#create-a-button-link" label="Click Me"]

```lang-markup
[[button link="#create-a-button-link" label="Click Me"]]
```

To make a button extra large, also include the `size` attribute with the value `large`:

[button link="#create-a-button-link" label="Large Click Me" size="large"]

```lang-markup
[[button link="#create-a-button-link" label="Large Click Me" size="large"]]
```

### Add a call-to-action at the end of blog posts

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSKWL_TA_5A?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, visit `Posts > Post Options`, and add your content. Click `Save` at the bottom of the page when you're done.

### Disable comments site-wide

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXSrhQZj05s?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, visit `Posts > Post Options`, and click `Disable comments on all blog posts`. Click `Save` at the bottom of the page when you're done.

## Footer Content

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUDDyqpZ8ZI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, visit `Appearance > Theme Options`, and add links to your accounts. Items left blank will be skipped. You can also add footer content. Click `Save` at the bottom of the page when you're done.

## Recommendations

Recommended plugins and services to get the most impact out of your site.

### Plugins

- [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) will allow you to automatically update your website when new versions of this theme come out.
- [JetPack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) adds a ton of useful features, including contact forms and automatic plugin updates.
- [Manual Control for JetPack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/manual-control/) prevents JetPack from automatically enabling new features when you update the plugin.
- [Contact Form 7](http://contactform7.com/) is an amazing contact form plugin for WordPress.
- [The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com/) is a robust, feature-rich events calendar.
- [ZenCache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zencache/) makes your website load a lot faster.

### Web Hosting

#### If you have no in-house web/digital team and no idea what you're doing...

[GoDaddy's Managed WordPress hosting](https://www.godaddy.com/pro/managed-wordpress-hosting) is inexpensive, easy to use, and comes with great customer support. There's a lot to hate about GoDaddy (from their sexist advertising to their elephant-hunting CEO), but if you want cheap, reliable hosting with some nice security features built in, they're hard to beat.

#### If you have a web/digital team and want something better...

I cannot say enough great things about [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/08a079d9bd9a). Their plans start at just $5 a month and all of the sites I host with them are lightning fast. [Use my referral link](https://m.do.co/c/08a079d9bd9a) and you'll get a free $10 credit.

I use [ServerPilot](https://serverpilot.io/) with DigitalOcean. ServerPilot automates a lot of the "getting setup" stuff involved in working with DigitalOcean.

For domain registration, I like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). They're inexpensive and really easy to work with.
